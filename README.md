# game-of-life

## Getting Setup

You will need to download the project with git.

Download the project using `git clone git@github.com:nadrane/game-of-life.git`

## Running the Program

You can open the game in your browser by pasting in the file path to your `index.html` in the URL search bar.

The filepath will look something like this: `file:///Users/nickdrane/clients/spantree/rush/game-of-life/index.html`

## Completing the game

I've written some scaffolding that gets the game working on the web, but I've omitted the implementations to some key functions.

Your job is to get complete these functions. All of the code is located in `app.js`
